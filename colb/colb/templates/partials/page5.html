          &quot;The Colb team has unique expertise not usually encountered in
          the market nowadays the combination of blockchain, crypto, and legal
          understanding. I initially attempted to work with big law firms in
          order to find what I ultimately discovered it at Colb. I am gratified
          and secure at having this team with us for Monnos’ journey from the
          outset. With Colb I am sure that we are prepared for whatever our
          ambitions require.&quot;
