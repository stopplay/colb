        Society claims for alternatives for commercialization of illiquid assets. Tokenization allows anyone to perform a transaction as easy as sending an email.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;The asset can be represented by more than one digital title, called a token. The property right or claim is embodied into a token, performing an ideal fragment of the asset, which is negotiable separately and worldwide, through smart contracts, without an intermediary. 
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;At Colb, the process involves four steps, from the legal and financial aspects of the tokenized asset to the marketing and communication, not to forget the technological genesis of the token in the blockchain, to grant the listing and distribution with distinction.
